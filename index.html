                <h2 class="orange">Caesar Salad</h2>
                <p>Perhaps the best salad of all time, and we have lightened it up. A Caesar Salad is such a
                    classic!
                    Crisp lettuce, shredded chicken and crunchy croutons, all smothered in a creamy dressing. <br>

                <h2 class="orange"> Steam steak</h2>
                <p> If you want something different, try steaming your steak. However, don't steam steaks as you would a
                    vegetable on the stove. <br>
                    Simply placing the steak in the steamer basket will result in a gray.

                        If you love Indian food you have to try this recipe! This Chicken Curry tastes just as good as
                        what you’d get at an Indian restaurant, if not better, and it’s easy to make. <br>
